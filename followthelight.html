        <h5 class="plot_paragraph">Based on several articles reviewed by the team we were under the assumption that a rise in the global temperature would directly impact the increase in suicide rates. We were able to analyze data from Kaggle and DataHub and extract information that was necessary to come to our conclusion.
            The conclusion: A Rise in global temperature associated with the decrease in suicide rates globally.
            There are probably external factors that have led to the decrease in suicide rates over the years which can include but are not limited to the increase in mental health awareness and services. Those factors were not explored.</h5>

       <p class="plot_paragraph" > The HDI stands for Human Development Index which is used to rank countries by per capita income, life expectancy, and education. 
       We used this to determine the countries that were the most developed, which we believed to have more accurate repotting of suicide data than those of lower index. </p>

      <p class="plot_paragraph" > This grap is the same as above, but with the suicide rate of 5 per 100k or more. We did this to remove the countries which have reported 0 suicides(which seems unlikely)
        or didn't report any which may have skewed the data. </p>
